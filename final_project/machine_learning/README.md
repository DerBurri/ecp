# Machine Learning Approximation Tests

## Lenet

The Lenet is the notebook from homework and is needs generate lookup tables from generate_numpy_table_for_lenet.py

For this the right truth tables have to be copied into the script.

In the Lenet Jupyter Notebook the calculations are made and the results are plotted.

## KNN

The KNN notebook contains the implementations of the adder in Python and also do the energy measurements and delay measurements.

The cells in the KNN Notebook can be run easily.

In the Function that creates the dataset the subset size of the MNIST Dataset can be adjusted.
